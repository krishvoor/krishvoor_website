abstract: In the era of artificial intelligence (AI) and running microservices in containers, Python and Node.js are common choices for developing current generation applications. These applications may need to connect to various data sources for different types of data. For customers who use Oracle Database as their operational database, the cx_Oracle and node-oracledb modules provide an easy method for connecting Phyton or Node.js applications to an Oracle Database running on any platform.
