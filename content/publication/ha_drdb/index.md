abstract: This article describes high availability (HA), disaster recovery (DR), and fail-over for Linux on Power virtual machines (VMs) or logical partitions (LPARs). The solution described in this article works for all Linux distributions available for IBM® POWER8® and later processor-based servers. Open sources used in this solution are Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD) and heartbeat, which are available for all supported distributions. We have used Ubuntu v16.04, supported on IBM Power® servers, to explain and verify the solution.
