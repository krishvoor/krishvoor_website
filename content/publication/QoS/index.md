abstract: This tutorial chronicles our experiences configuring Red Hat® OpenShift Container Platform (for brevity we will refer to this as OCP) on the IBM® Power® platform, building an application to deploy, and then deploying the application on OCP. Helm chart is used to define, install, and upgrade the geospatial workload application running on MongoDB on the OCP cluster. Docker images for the geospatial application running on MongoDB is built and pushed in to the OpenShift Docker registry, deployed using helm. The tutorial also describes the tunings that are used to get the maximum containers with optimum performance to be hosted on the OCP cluster on the IBM Power platform.
