summary: Pack-em or stack-em Advantages of running OpenShift on Power
abstract: This talk is about the (container density, pod scaling) tests performed with OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) and compared different architectures. Effectiveness of using IBM Power Systems with OpenShift Container Platform which can host most containers or pods without performance degradation compared to other platforms. A "DevOps" scenario with a workload similar to a MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node) is selected. The workload was purposeful to further demonstrate the price-performance advantage of using OpenShift with IBM Power/OpenPOWER Platform.
