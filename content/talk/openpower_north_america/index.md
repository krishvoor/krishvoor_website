location: San Diego, California

summary: Pack-em or stack-em Advantages of running OpenShift on Power
abstract: In this session, you will hear about the (container density, pod scaling) tests we performed with  OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) and compared different architectures. You will ascertain the effectiveness of using POWER Systems with OpenShift Container Platform which can host most containers or pods without performance degradation compared to other platforms.  A  “DevOps” scenario with a workload similar to a  MEAN  stack (Mongo,  Express, Angular,  and  Node) is selected.  The workload was purposeful to further demonstrate the price-performance advantage of using OpenShift with POWER Platform.
